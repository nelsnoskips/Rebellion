 * The brand's painted layer — watercolour washes, thrown ink, torn paper and

 * annotation; "collected over time, not generated from a template").
 *
 * Each texture ships as an alpha mask in /public/artwork, so the colour always
 * comes from a palette token: these components paint `currentColor` through the
 * mask, which means a Tailwind `text-*` class recolours the artwork. Generated
 * by scripts/generate-artwork.py and replaceable with scanned artwork that
 * follows the same mask convention.
 *
