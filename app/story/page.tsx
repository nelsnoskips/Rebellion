                  We are a chef- and wine-led house in Cocoa Beach, built for
                  people who want character without pretension. The kitchen
                  works with the season and the boats. The bar works with
                  whatever is ripe. The cellar is deep because somebody here
                  cannot stop reading about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The result is a room that feels considered and a little
                  surprising, and completely its own — the kind of place where a
                  Tuesday turns into a story.
